Rulebook Documentation
======================

**Rulebook** is a *statically-checked imperative language* that turns **interactive behaviour**—reinforcement-learning, video-game logic, or in general `complex interactive subsystems <./the_inversion_of_control_problem.html#complex-interactive-subsystems>`_—into something you can **query, replay, fuzz, and formally verify**.

`4hammer (our flagship demo) <./ui_gameplay.html#4hammer>`_ shows Rulebook in action.

**Why Rulebook?**

* `Capture every run <./language_tour.html#spin-functions-implications>`_ – automatically store, load, print, replay, and mutate both state *and* execution traces.
* **Push-button testing** – drop in standard `fuzzers <./language_tour.html#automatic-testing>`_, formal `proofs <./language_tour.html#finite-interactive-programs>`_, or `reinforcement-learning agents <./language_tour.html#reinforcement-learning>`_.
* `Self-configuring UIs <./language_tour.html#self-configuring-uis>`_ – the UI introspects your program graph and adapts its controls on the fly.
* `Remote execution <./language_tour.html#remote-execution>`_ – ship interactive logic across the network with a zero-boilerplate RPC layer.
* Solve the `interactive inversion-of-control problem <./the_inversion_of_control_problem.html>`_ at the language level—no more interactive spaghetti.

**Under the hood**

Rulebook’s defining idea is the notion of `Action functions with SPIN properties <./language_tour.html#action-functions>`_, which make all of the above possible.

**Integration**

Rulebook compiles to **one shared library (or WebAssembly module)** with a C-compatible ABI and generated bindings for `C, C++, C#, Python, and Godot Script <./language_tour.html#compatibility>`_. Use it the way SQL complements those languages—drop it in wherever **interactive logic** is the hard part.

**Rulebook** is an **imperative language** for building `complex interactive subsystems <./the_inversion_of_control_problem.html#complex-interactive-subsystems>`_—­reinforcement-learning environments, video games, UIs with graph-like transitions, multistep procedures, and more.

`Check out <./ui_gameplay.html#4hammer>`_ our flagship example program.

The language is **compiled and statically checked**. Its defining innovation is the notion of `Action functions with SPIN properties <./language_tour.html#action-functions>`_, which let you:

* `store, load, print, replay, and modify <./language_tour.html#spin-functions-implications>`_ both execution traces and program state
* **automatically test** interactive code with off-the-shelf `fuzzers <./language_tour.html#automatic-testing>`_, formal `proofs <./language_tour.html#finite-interactive-programs>`_, and `reinforcement-learning agents <./language_tour.html#reinforcement-learning>`_
* build `self-configuring UIs <./language_tour.html#self-configuring-uis>`_ that introspect the programs they present and adapt themselves automatically
* `execute interactive code remotely <./language_tour.html#remote-execution>`_ over the network
* solve the `interactive inversion-of-control problem <./the_inversion_of_control_problem.html>`_ at the language level


Rulebook:

* **aids—rather than replaces—** `C, C++, C#, Python, and Godot Script <./language_tour.html#compatibility>`_, (just like SQL aids but replaces those languages) 
* emits a single shared library (or WebAssembly module for web targets) with a C-compatible ABI, plus generated bindings for your host language

UI, Controller and Gameplay Programming
########################################

`UI, controller <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller>`_ and gameplay programming are among the sections that benefit the most from using Rulebook. Beside automatically `fuzz <./language_tour.html#automatic-testing>`_ , `prove correct <./language_tour.html#finite-interactive-programs>`_ and `run reinforcement learning on <./language_tour.html#reinforcement-learning>`_ your program, write  `self-configuring UIs <./language_tour.html#self-configuring-uis>`_ , Rulebook automatically provides a sharp division between UI concerns and Controllers or Gameplay.
