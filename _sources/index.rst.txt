Rulebook documentation
======================

**Rulebook** is a language to bolt onto other languages to solve the `inversion of control problem <./the_inversion_of_control_problem.html>`_ in **complex interactive programs** (reinforcement learning environments, videogames, UIs with graph like transitions, multistep procedures, ...).

**Rulebook**:

* solves **inversion of control problem** at the language level, no other language does.
* requires **asymptotically** less code write **complex interactive programs**.
* is designed to **aid**, but not replace, and can **interoperate** with c, cpp, c#, python and godot script.

Furthermore, by solving the **Inversion of Control Problem**, **Rulebook** obtains.

* **storable** and **resumable** coroutines.
* **automatic testing** with fuzzers and reinforcement learning.
* **automatic tracing** of executions.
* **automatic remote execution** over network.
* **allow for self-configuring UIs**, where the UIs can inspect the underlying program it presenting and configure itself accordingly.

**Reinforcement learning environments** are often subject to **Inversion of Control Problem**, since they must be stopped and resumed every time the artificial agent wishes to take a action. The following documents in detail what rulebook does in that domain. In particular we show how:

* How to interoperate **rulebook** with **python**.
* How you can write almost arbitrary functions, turn them into a **GYM** environment and have your custom agents learn from such environments.
