Rulebook documentation
======================

**Rulebook** is a language to bolt onto other languages to solve the `inversion of control problem <./the_inversion_of_control_problem.html>`_ in **complex interactive programs** (reinforcement learning environments, videogames, UIs with graph-like transitions, multistep procedures, ...).

**Rulebook**:

* solves the **inversion of control problem** at the language level â€” no other language does.
* requires **asymptotically** less code to write **complex interactive programs**.
* is designed to **aid**, not replace, and can **interoperate** with C, C++, C#, Python, and Godot Script.

Furthermore, by solving the **inversion of control problem**, **Rulebook** enables:

* **storable** and **resumable** coroutines.
* **automatic testing** using fuzzers and reinforcement learning.
* **automatic tracing** of executions.
* **automatic remote execution** over the network.
* **self-configuring UIs**, where UIs can inspect the underlying program they present and configure themselves accordingly.

**Reinforcement learning environments** are often subject to the **Inversion of Control Problem**, since they must be stopped and resumed every time the artificial agent wishes to take an action. The following documents in detail what **Rulebook** does in that domain. In particular, we show:

* how to interoperate **Rulebook** with **Python**.
* how you can write almost arbitrary functions, turn them into a **GYM** environment, and have your custom agents learn from such environments.
