# UI, Controller and Gameplay

# 4Hammer
Our flagship example is 4Hammer ([source code](https://github.com/rl-language/4Hammer)), a reinforcement-learning environment with extreamly complex interactive sequences into \~5 k lines of code (graphics included). Thanks to Rulebook, 4Hammer automatically gains:

* reinforcement-learning support
* fuzzer-based testing
* textual state encoding
* trace replay
* remote execution
* self-configuring UIs

â€”all in both browser and desktop builds.
